NOTE:

On Windows, macOS, and Linux, it is best to install Anaconda for the local user, which does not require administrator permissions and is the most robust type of installation. However, with administrator permissions, you can install Anaconda system wide.

In case pip is missing, alternative ways to install pip include:

MacOS:

 - curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
 - python3 get-pip.py


Windows:
Follow instructions here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

 - Download the script, from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py (go to https://bootstrap.pypa.io, find get-pip.py, right click on it, save)
 - Open terminal/command prompt, change directory to the folder containing the get-pip.py file (e.g. cd Downloads) and run:
 - python get-pip.py
