Beginners guide to setting up tesseract, tailored for non-technical users!

Download the code (as zip file) from https://github.com/ektavats/OCR-tesseract-SE/tree/main
Save it on your computer, working folder.
Copy some sample images in this folder, if any.

Follow these instructions for setting up the OCR code.


Mac OS:

1. Download anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Install anaconda (pkg file in Downloads folder, follow default options)
3. Open terminal
4. conda create --name pytess python=3.8 pip numpy pandas matplotlib (press y, enter)
5. conda activate pytess
6. pip install Jupyter lab
7. pip install pytesseract
8. Install tesseract: 
 - The easiest way to install Tesseract OCR on Mac is using Homebrew. 
 - If you don't have Homebrew installed, just go to Homebrew's site (http://brew.sh/), open your terminal, and run the Ruby script that is on the front page. echo "export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
- You may be required to type in your administrator password.
 - brew install tesseract
 - The tesseract directory can then be found using brew info tesseract (if needed)
 - e.g. /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tesseract/4.1.3/
9. In the terminal type: tesseract
 - Any error? If not, then we are good :)
 - Error (tesseract not found)? Add tesseract path to system environment. 
10. The English language is already included in this installation. If you want to install other language packs, just run the following command:
 - brew install tesseract --all-languages 
11. type: tesseract --list-langs 
 - can you see all the languages? 
- If not, restart the terminal and type the same command after: conda activate pytess
12. pip install opencv-python
13. type: jupyter lab
14. select OCR_singleImage.ipynb. Run (two arrow buttons).


NOTE:
To run the code after the set up, or for future use:
1. Open the terminal
2. conda activate pytess
3. cd your/code/folder/path
4. jupyter lab

NOTE:
For details on more languages: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html
For adding more languages, simply use e.g. "swe + eng + deu" (i.e. Swedish, English, German.)
